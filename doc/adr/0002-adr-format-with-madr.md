# 2. ADR format with MADR

Date: 2020-06-22

## Status

Superceded by [3. ADR format with lightweight ADR](0003-adr-format-with-lightweight-adr.md)

## Context

We need to decide a format of ADR, so that we can have a similar tool chain.

## Decision

[MADR](https://adr.github.io/madr/)

## Consequences

It is more time to understand and use, and this will reduce the motivation of users.
